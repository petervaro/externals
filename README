EXTERNALS
=========

Repository for all packages that are not available (or does not have the correct
version or build variant) in the Arch offficial and user repositories. It
contains a small script, that helps update, build and install these packages.

> This software is may or may not be helpful for others. (Different developers
> on different distributions have different needs.) Because of that, it is not
> highly customizable and can only be extended manually -- and this will not
> change in the future!
